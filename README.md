# auto-crossbreeding

***Sometimes transvector dislocator would stop working and transport itself. DO NOT REPORT THIS AS AN ISSUE. I'm pretty aware of it.***

## Setup

**Robot upgrades:**

- Inventory Upgrade
- Inventory Controller Upgrade
- Redstone Card
- Geolyzer (block)
- Internet Card (if you want to install over internet, not necessary.)

**Robot inventory:**

You need to put a spade in the last slot of the robot (if you have multiple inventory upgrades, you may scroll down to reach the last slot.)

You need to put a transvector binder to the second last slot.

The crop sticks will end up in the third slot. You don't need to put them manually. The robot will automatically retrieve them from crop stick container automatically if needed.
